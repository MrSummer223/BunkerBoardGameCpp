Hello there! If you are reading this I will just say that this project is my first serious project , its small , 
simple and other people could make the same easily , but I was doing this hardly ,  I wanted to make something cool 
for peoples , so this C++ project is a Bunker Bunker Board Game but its electronically version , for the people who 
cant afford it .

How to use it? :
You can activate this code in Visual Studio in Windows , in Xcode in macbook
or if you wanted to activate is in the phone , just copy the Bunker.cpp content and paste it
into the online compiler
